## What Is This App?

Control & Predict is a therapeutic web application that helps children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) understand cause-and-effect relationships in everyday situations. Through interactive animated scenarios, children learn to predict what happens next, building crucial cognitive and social skills.

The app provides a safe, visually engaging environment where children can:
- **Watch** familiar scenarios unfold
- **Predict** what happens next by choosing from options
- **Learn** from immediate, gentle feedback
- **Practice** with repetition in a stress-free setting
